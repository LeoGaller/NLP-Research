# NLP-Research
Research about NLP.

This code aims to improve my knowledge on Natural Language Processing and at the same time develop more advanced analysis at my work. 
The aim is to understand what our users are saying about the system we develope to them.

The code were totally implemented using Python 3.6 using Anaconda environment.

The packages used were:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NLTK
- wordcloud
- pyvis.network

I tried to program it using the Functional Paradigm, so, if you find something not functional, be aware that I am still learning! :)
Any comment would be appreciated.

Best Regards!
